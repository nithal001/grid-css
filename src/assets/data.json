            "CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows.",
            "You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) and to that elements children (which become Grid Items).",
            "CSS Grid Layout (aka 'Grid'), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces.",
            "CSS has always been used to lay out our web pages, but it's never done a very good job of it.",
            "First we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance).",
            "Flexbox helped out, but it's intended for simpler one-dimensional layouts, not complex two-dimensional ones (Flexbox and Grid actually work very well together)."
